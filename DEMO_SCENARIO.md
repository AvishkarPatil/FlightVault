## 🚨 The Crisis (Act 1: 30 seconds)

### The Disaster Strikes

**Time**: 02:15:47 AM IST  
**Location**: Production Database Server  
**Incident**: Accidental Mass Deletion

A junior developer, working on a data cleanup script for test environments, accidentally connected to the production database and executed:

```sql
DELETE FROM airports WHERE city = 'Mumbai';
```

**Immediate Impact:**
- ✈️ 9 Mumbai airports vanished from the database
- 🔗 156 active flight routes now reference non-existent airports
- ⚠️ Foreign key violations cascade across 3 related tables
- 📱 Booking website starts showing "Airport Not Found" errors
- 💰 Every minute of downtime costs $8,000 in lost bookings
- 📞 Customer support phones lighting up with complaints

**Traditional Response Time:**
- Find latest backup file: 15 minutes
- Restore from backup: 45 minutes
- Validate data integrity: 20 minutes
- Test affected systems: 30 minutes
- **Total downtime: 110 minutes**
- **Lost revenue: $880,000**
- **Customer complaints: 347**
- **Reputation damage: Severe**
